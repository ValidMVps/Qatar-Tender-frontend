  "content": "<h2>Purpose & Scope</h2><p>Winning the tender is only the start. Effective contract management ensures delivery, reduces disputes and protects both parties. This article covers the essential steps to manage awarded contracts successfully.</p><h2>Immediate Post-Award Tasks</h2><ol><li><strong>Award Letter & Contract Signing</strong><p>Issue a formal award letter, attach the final contract, and collect signed copies. Use an acknowledgement form to capture any immediate clarifications.</p></li><li><strong>Assign Governance</strong><p>Define the project governance: project manager, commercial lead, and steering committee. Provide contact details and escalation paths.</p></li><li><strong>Kick-off Meeting</strong><p>Hold a kick-off within 7–10 days of award. Share a draft delivery schedule, communication plan, risk register, and initial resource plan.</p></li></ol><h2>Planning & Baseline</h2><p>Agree on a baseline plan with milestones and acceptance criteria. The baseline is the reference for progress tracking and change requests. Ensure both parties sign off on milestone definitions.</p><h2>Change Control & Variations</h2><p>Define a written change control process: submit request → impact assessment (time & cost) → approval → documentation and update baseline. Track all change requests in a register with unique IDs and dates.</p><h2>Performance Monitoring & Reporting</h2><p>Establish a reporting cadence (weekly operational reports and monthly executive dashboards). Include metrics such as:</p><ul><li>Schedule performance (milestone completion %)</li><li>Earned value indicators (if applicable)</li><li>Quality non-conformance incidents</li><li>Open change requests</li><li>Financial status vs baseline (invoiced vs planned)</li></ul><h2>Payments & Invoicing</h2><p>Link invoices to milestone or deliverable acceptance. Use a simple invoice checklist: invoice number, purchase order reference, description matched to milestone, instrument references for retention claims, and bank details. Avoid vague invoices that delay payments.</p><h2>Risk Management</h2><p>Maintain a live risk register with owners, likelihood, impact, and mitigation steps. Review risks in weekly operational meetings and escalate the top 5 risks to the steering committee monthly.</p><h2>Quality & Acceptance</h2><p>Define acceptance tests and deliverable quality checks. Use sign-off templates that record the person responsible, test evidence, and any corrective actions. Keep all acceptance records centralized on the platform for audit trails.</p><h2>Stakeholder Communication</h2><p>Have a RACI for stakeholder communications. Agree on who communicates what to whom (client, subcontractors, regulators). Use short status emails with key actions and decisions to maintain a clean record.</p><h2>Dispute Prevention & Resolution</h2><p>Most disputes arise from poor documentation or unmanaged variations. Minimize risk by documenting decisions, maintaining a change log and agreeing on quick, pragmatic resolution steps in the contract (initial negotiation → mediation → arbitration as last resort).</p><h2>Project Closeout</h2><ol><li><strong>Final Acceptance:</strong> complete outstanding items and obtain a final acceptance certificate.</li><li><strong>Financial Close:</strong> settle retention, final payments, and release performance guarantees as per the contract.</li><li><strong>Knowledge Transfer:</strong> hand over documentation, training material and maintenance schedules.</li><li><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong> conduct a lessons-learned workshop and store the findings for future procurements.</li></ol><h2>Templates & Checklists</h2><p>Below are short templates you can copy:</p><h3>Sample Kick-off Agenda</h3><ul><li>Introductions & roles</li><li>Scope review</li><li>Baseline schedule</li><li>Reporting cadence</li><li>Risk register review</li><li>Immediate next steps</li></ul><h3>Change Request Register Columns</h3><ul><li>CR ID</li><li>Date Submitted</li><li>Requested By</li><li>Description</li><li>Impact (Time & Cost)</li><li>Status</li><li>Approval Date</li></ul><h2>Closing Remarks</h2><p>Good contract management converts awards into value. Invest time early in governance, baseline planning and simple, enforceable change controls — it pays back through fewer disputes, better timelines and higher client satisfaction.</p>"
